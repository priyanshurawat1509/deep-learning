This repository includes the mini projects for the <b><u>Deep Learning</b></u> course completed on the following topics :
- Deep neural networks (DNNs),
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),
- Recurrent and Recursive Neural Networks (RNN),
- Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM),
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

All projects were done with `Python` in `Jupyter Notebook`. 
Libraries used: `Numpy`, `Tensorflow`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, `Sklearn`
