This repository includes the mini projects for the Deep Learning course completed on the following topics : 
- <h4><b>Deep neural networks (DNNs),</b></h4>
- <h4>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),</b></h4> 
- <h4>Recurrent and Recursive Neural Networks (RNN),</b></h4>
- <h4>Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM),</b></h3>
- <h4>Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b></h3>
