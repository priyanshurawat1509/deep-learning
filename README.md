This repository includes the mini projects for the <b><u>Deep Learning</b></u> course completed on the following topics :
- <b>Deep neural networks (DNNs),</b>
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),</b>
- Recurrent and Recursive Neural Networks (RNN),</b>
- Long Short-Term Memory (LTSM),</b>
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)</b>

All projects were done with Python in Jupyter Notebook. 
Libraries used: `Numpy`, `Tensorflow`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`, `Sklearn`
